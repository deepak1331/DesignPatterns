 *         In eager initialization, the instance of the singleton class is
 *         created at the time of class loading. The drawback to eager
 *         initialization is that the method is created even though the client
 *         application might not be using it. Below is the implementation of the
 *         static initialization singleton class:
 *
 *         If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources, this is the
 *         approach to use. But in most of the scenarios, singleton classes are
 *         created for resources such as File System, Database connections, etc.
 *         We should avoid the instantiation unless the client calls the
 *         getInstance method. Also, this method doesnï¿½t provide any options for
 *         exception handling.
